FUNCTION
<<signal>>---specify handler subroutine for a signal

INDEX
	signal
INDEX
	_signal_r

ANSI_SYNOPSIS
	#include <signal.h>
	void (*signal(int <[sig]>, void(*<[func]>)(int))) (int);

	void (*_signal_r(void *<[reent]>, int <[sig]>, void(*<[func]>)(int))) (int);

TRAD_SYNOPSIS
	#include <signal.h>
	char ( * signal(<[sig]>, <[func]>) )()
	int <[sig]>;
	char ( * <[func]> )();

	char ( * _signal_r(<[reent]>, <[sig]>, <[func]>) )()
	char *<[reent]>;
	int <[sig]>;
	char ( * <[func]> )();

DESCRIPTION
<<signal>> provides a simple signal-handling implementation for embedded
targets.

<<signal>> allows you to request changed treatment for a particular
signal <[sig]>.  You can use one of the predefined macros <<SIG_DFL>>
(select system default handling) or <<SIG_IGN>> (ignore this signal)
as the value of <[func]>; otherwise, <[func]> is a function pointer
that identifies a subroutine in your program as the handler for this signal.

Some of the execution environment for signal handlers is
unpredictable; notably, the only library function required to work
correctly from within a signal handler is <<signal>> itself, and
only when used to redefine the handler for the current signal value.

Static storage is likewise unreliable for signal handlers, with one
exception: if you declare a static storage location as `<<volatile
sig_atomic_t>>', then you may use that location in a signal handler to
store signal values.

If your signal handler terminates using <<return>> (or implicit
return), your program's execution continues at the point
where it was when the signal was raised (whether by your program
itself, or by an external event).  Signal handlers can also
use functions such as <<exit>> and <<abort>> to avoid returning.

The alternate function <<_signal_r>> is the reentrant version.
The extra argument <[reent]> is a pointer to a reentrancy structure.

@c FIXME: do we have setjmp.h and assoc fns?

RETURNS
If your request for a signal handler cannot be honored, the result is
<<SIG_ERR>>; a specific error number is also recorded in <<errno>>.

Otherwise, the result is the previous handler (a function pointer or
one of the predefined macros).

PORTABILITY
ANSI C requires <<signal>>.

No supporting OS subroutines are required to link with <<signal>>, but
it will not have any useful effects, except for software generated signals,
without an operating system that can actually raise exceptions.

/*
 * signal.c
 * Original Author:	G. Haley
 *
 * signal associates the function pointed to by func with the signal sig. When
 * a signal occurs, the value of func determines the action taken as follows:
 * if func is SIG_DFL, the default handling for that signal will occur; if func
 * is SIG_IGN, the signal will be ignored; otherwise, the default handling for
 * the signal is restored (SIG_DFL), and the function func is called with sig
 * as its argument. Returns the value of func for the previous call to signal
 * for the signal sig, or SIG_ERR if the request fails.

/* errno is not a global variable, because that would make using it

   files aren't affected).  */
/* This file can define macros to choose variations of the IEEE float
   format:

   _FLT_LARGEST_EXPONENT_IS_NORMAL

	Defined if the float format uses the largest exponent for finite
	numbers rather than NaN and infinity representations.  Such a
	format cannot represent NaNs or infinities at all, but it's FLT_MAX
	is twice the IEEE value.

   _FLT_NO_DENORMALS

	Defined if the float format does not support IEEE denormals.  Every
	float with a zero exponent is taken to be a zero representation.
 
   ??? At the moment, there are no equivalent macros above for doubles and
   the macros are not fully supported by --enable-newlib-hw-fp.

   __IEEE_BIG_ENDIAN

        Defined if the float format is big endian.  This is mutually exclusive
        with __IEEE_LITTLE_ENDIAN.

   __IEEE_LITTLE_ENDIAN
 
        Defined if the float format is little endian.  This is mutually exclusive
        with __IEEE_BIG_ENDIAN.

   Note that one of __IEEE_BIG_ENDIAN or __IEEE_LITTLE_ENDIAN must be specified for a
   platform or error will occur.

   __IEEE_BYTES_LITTLE_ENDIAN

        This flag is used in conjunction with __IEEE_BIG_ENDIAN to describe a situation 
	whereby multiple words of an IEEE floating point are in big endian order, but the
	words themselves are little endian with respect to the bytes.

   _DOUBLE_IS_32_BITS 

        This is used on platforms that support double by using the 32-bit IEEE
        float type.

   _FLOAT_ARG

        This represents what type a float arg is passed as.  It is used when the type is
        not promoted to double.

/* This header file provides the reentrancy.  */

/* The reentrant system calls here serve two purposes:

   1) Provide reentrant versions of the system calls the ANSI C library
      requires.
   2) Provide these system calls in a namespace clean way.

   It is intended that *all* system calls that the ANSI C library needs
   be declared here.  It documents them all in one place.  All library access
   to the system is via some form of these functions.

   There are three ways a target may provide the needed syscalls.

   1) Define the reentrant versions of the syscalls directly.
      (eg: _open_r, _close_r, etc.).  Please keep the namespace clean.
      When you do this, set "syscall_dir" to "syscalls" and add
      -DREENTRANT_SYSCALLS_PROVIDED to newlib_cflags in configure.host.

   2) Define namespace clean versions of the system calls by prefixing
      them with '_' (eg: _open, _close, etc.).  Technically, there won't be
      true reentrancy at the syscall level, but the library will be namespace
      clean.
      When you do this, set "syscall_dir" to "syscalls" in configure.host.

   3) Define or otherwise provide the regular versions of the syscalls
      (eg: open, close, etc.).  The library won't be reentrant nor namespace
      clean, but at least it will work.
      When you do this, add -DMISSING_SYSCALL_NAMES to newlib_cflags in
      configure.host.

   Stubs of the reentrant versions of the syscalls exist in the libc/reent
   source directory and are used if REENTRANT_SYSCALLS_PROVIDED isn't defined.
   They use the native system calls: _open, _close, etc. if they're available
   (MISSING_SYSCALL_NAMES is *not* defined), otherwise open, close, etc.
   (MISSING_SYSCALL_NAMES *is* defined).  */

/* WARNING: All identifiers here must begin with an underscore.  This file is
   included by stdio.h and others and we therefore must only use identifiers
   in the namespace allotted to us.  */

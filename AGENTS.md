# Agent guide

Routing and integrity rules for coding agents (and people) working in this repository: a matching decompilation of
the PSP game LittleBigPlanet (UCUS98744 v2.00). The method and most tools follow the Hot Shots Tennis: Get a Grip
decomp; this file says which document to read for which task and lists the rules that are never relaxed.

## Game data never enters this repository

- Never commit or attach retail bytes, decrypted modules, disassembly dumps, decompiler output of whole modules, keys
  or anything else taken from the disc. Every build reads the user's own copy of the game from the gitignored
  `inputs/` and `campaign/`.
- Never post retail bytes, disassembly or decompiler output to a public or web service (decomp.me scratches,
  pastebins, issues, web tools).
- Machine paths live only in the gitignored `lbp-config.json`.
- Sony SDK code the game links (FIOS, SCREAM, SceRT, the SNC library, crt0) is not reconstructed here; `ORIGINS.json`
  gives the origin class of every source.

## Read first

| Task | Read |
| --- | --- |
| Setting up from your own disc, the tools | [README.md](README.md), [docs/GUIDE.md](docs/GUIDE.md) |
| Road to byte-identical 100% | [docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md), [docs/COMPLETION.md](docs/COMPLETION.md) |
| Matching a function: method, file format, note line | [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) |
| Compiler behaviour and the compiler builds | [docs/TOOLCHAIN.md](docs/TOOLCHAIN.md), [toolchain/gcc4/README.md](toolchain/gcc4/README.md) |
| Licences | [THIRD_PARTY.md](THIRD_PARTY.md), `REUSE.toml` (`python tools/lbpreuse.py check`) |

## Integrity rules (never relaxed)

- **Only EXACT counts.** A source is a match only when `python tools/lbpmatch.py <file>` reports `EXACT` for the
  installed file: the compiled and linked bytes equal retail with no masking.
- **Real source only.** No machine code in a source: no `asm` statements that emit instructions, no
  `.word`/`.byte`/`.incbin`, no code-emitting pragmas, no data steered into `.text`, no `extra=` header or `--flags`
  result in `src/`. `tools/lbpgate.py` refuses such a source (`EXACT_FAILS_GATE`).
- **One exception, inline VFPU asm.** LittleBigPlanet's sources used inline VFPU assembly. Where the original clearly
  used it, a matched source may contain `asm`/`__asm__` statements whose templates hold **only VFPU instructions**,
  provided the header carries `asm=vfpu` and a comment gives the reason on a line starting `Original inline VFPU asm:`.
  Any other instruction in a template, or a missing key or reason, is refused.
- **No steering tricks presented as code.** Duplicated conditions, dummy locals, `volatile`, self-assignments,
  gratuitous casts or `goto` only when they are the only exact form found, and then named in the note line.
- **Relocatable.** Name every address through a symbol (`FUN_`/`DAT_` address names, or a line appended to
  `symbols/<module>.txt`), never through a numeric constant cast to a pointer.
- **Never edit the verdict.** Do not edit `tools/` as part of a matching change; `symbols/` is append-only.
- **Never lower a figure.** The 100% definition in `docs/COMPLETION.md` is fixed at its strictest.
- **Shared resources.** `--parallel 4` at most for `lbpmatch.py` on a shared machine.

# Contributing

This guide describes how functions are matched, installed and documented in this repository. It is hst-decomp's
CONTRIBUTING.md with the tool names changed; LBP-specific facts are in [docs/TOOLCHAIN.md](docs/TOOLCHAIN.md)
(compiler profiles) and `data/modules.json` (modules).

Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) first: its rules (game data never enters the repository; only EXACT counts) apply to
every change.

## Ground rules

- **A source enters `src/` only when `tools/lbpmatch.py` reports `EXACT` for it.** Exact means the compiled and linked
  bytes equal the retail bytes of the function, with no masking. There are no near misses in `src/`.
- Code taken from another project (newlib is the case so far) keeps its copyright and licence notices and is listed in
  `THIRD_PARTY.md`; do not remove a notice and do not paste a compiler's or SDK's header text into a source (the
  project-authored headers in `include/` exist for that). Library sources are produced by `tools/lbpnewlib.py`.
- Do not commit game data of any kind: no retail modules, no disassembly dumps of whole modules, no keys, no
  compilers. The ignore rules already exclude binaries and key files; keep it that way.
- Do not edit existing lines of `symbols/` (appending is allowed, see below), and do not edit `tools/` as part of a
  matching change.
- The tools that write into `src/` (`lbpgen`, `lbpclone`, `lbptmpl`, `lbpperm`, `lbpnewlib`) and the one that builds
  batches for matching agents (`lbpqueue`) are run deliberately by whoever runs the campaign, not casually while
  matching a function.
- Keep scratch work out of the tracked tree: use `try/<your-name>/` (gitignored). Build products go to
  `build/<module>/<dir>__<stem>__<digest>` (`tools/lbpmatch.py` `build_key`: the digest comes from the source's path,
  so equally named files in different directories never share build products).
- Do not search recursively (`grep -r`) outside `src/`, `wip/`, `docs/`, `symbols/`, `include/` and your own `try/`
  directory. The campaign directory and `build/` can hold gigabytes.

## Setting up

Follow [Setup](docs/GUIDE.md#setup) in the project guide, then check that one function builds:

```
python tools/lbpconfig.py check
python tools/lbpmatch.py src/eboot/<file>.c
```

## Method

1. **Pick a function.** `python tools/lbpfamilies.py` ranks unmatched clone families (code identical apart from
   addresses): one match unlocks the whole family, because `lbpclone.py` propagates it. For single functions,
   `python tools/lbpqueue.py` builds batches, listing the Ghidra pseudocode path and, if one exists, the best
   mechanically generated candidate (`best_generated.source`), which is a good starting point.
2. **Read the code.** `python tools/lbpdis.py 0xADDR` prints the retail disassembly of any reviewed function, so look at
   the callees and callers too: they tell you types, argument counts and what a call returns. The Ghidra pseudocode
   is advisory and often wrong in detail (see the compiler notes below).
3. **Write the function.** Start from the generated candidate, or write it by hand. Prefer natural code (structs with
   fields, member functions, loops with `break`) over the decompiler's pointer arithmetic.
4. **Iterate.** `python tools/lbpmatch.py <file>` compiles, links at the retail address and compares;
   `python tools/lbpdiff.py <file>` then prints your disassembly next to retail's, with `**` marking differing words.
   Always pass explicit file names. `--flags` and a header `extra=` are for experiments and never count as a match.
5. **Budget.** About 40 compiles per function is a reasonable limit. When stuck, move on and come back later; if you
   end within a few words, save a near miss (below).
6. **Install** the source once it is EXACT (below), and re-run the matcher on the installed file.

External references: address-named symbols (`FUN_xxxxxxxx`, `DAT_xxxxxxxx` with exactly 8 hex digits) link at their
address automatically. Every other name must be in `symbols/<module>.txt` (C++ runtime helpers, vtables, mangled
member names). If a match needs a new named symbol, verify its address in the disassembly, check with `grep` that the
name is not already there, and **append** one line:

```
printf '%s\n' 'name = 0xADDR;   # <your source file>' >> symbols/<module>.txt
```

A function whose constants or jump table live in `.rodata` needs `rodata=0xADDR` in the header, the address that
retail's `lui`/`lo` pair loads. The matcher then also requires the placed bytes to equal retail (`data=`, `sdata=`,
`bss=` and `sbss=` work the same way).

### Same-file static helpers

If retail's code depends on a `static` helper compiled earlier in the same file (for example MWCC keeping `a0` live
across a call it knows preserves `a0`, or a store in the `jal` delay slot), define the helper `static` in front of the
target, in retail address order, and list every function of the file other than the target in the header with its
own retail range: `helpers=FUN_0028fb44@0x0028fb44-0x0028fb70` (comma-separated for several). `start=`, `end=` and
`symbol=` stay the target's. The matcher links each function at its own address and compares every one; a helper that
differs is named in the mismatch, and a defined but unlisted function gives `MISPLACED`/`UNPLACED_FUNCTION`. The
source claims only the target's bytes: a helper is counted through its own one-function source, so install one if it
has none. Say in the note line that the helpers are placed by `helpers=`.

Only when the helper is directly adjacent and the run is short does the older form still apply: one source for the
contiguous run (`start=` the first function, `end=` the last, `symbol=` the first), named
`<name>_<first addr8>_run.cpp`, with "run" in the note line. Prefer `helpers=`.

## Source file format

**File name and place.** `src/<module dir>/` (the `src_dir` of the module in `data/modules.json`, e.g. `src/eboot/` for `EBOOT.BIN`); name the file
`<short_descriptive_name>_<addr8>.cpp` (or `.c`), where `<addr8>` is the start address in eight hex digits. Before
installing, check that nobody covered the function already (a duplicate must be removed, keeping the reviewed one):

```
grep -l "start=0x<addr>" src/*/* wip/*
```

**Line 1: the header.**

```c
/* LBPMATCH module=EBOOT.BIN start=0x0011d894 end=0x0011dad8 symbol=FUN_0011d894 lang=c++ */
```

`module`, `start`, `end` and `symbol` are required (`symbol` must be the name your source defines for the function).
`lang` is `c99` or `c++`. Optional: `cc=<profile>` (absent means MWCC build 219; GCC sources say `cc=gcc171-O2`,
`cc=gcc171-Os` or, for unoptimized SDK code, `cc=gcc171-O0`), the section placement keys above, and the experimental `extra=`.

**Line 2: the note.** Exactly one provenance note, and it must be true. "Hand-written" means a person wrote it; a
source that started from a generated candidate names the generator tag.

- Written from scratch, or heavily restructured:
  `/* Hand-written reconstruction from the disassembly; exact match verified; names and types await human review. */`
- Derived from a generated candidate with small corrections:
  `/* Ghidra pseudocode (lbpgen.py tag <tag>) corrected by hand: <what you changed>; exact match verified; names and types await human review. */`
- The tools write the other kinds themselves: `Mechanical translation of Ghidra pseudocode (lbpgen.py tag X)`,
  `Clone of src/... (lbpclone.py tag X)`, `... (template instance, lbptmpl.py tag X)` and
  `Library source: newlib <release> <dir>/<file>.c function <name>, ...`.

`python tools/lbplint.py` rejects a source without a known note kind.

## Inline VFPU asm (LBP project rule)

Project rule (2026-10-27): where LittleBigPlanet's original source clearly used inline VFPU assembly, the matched
source reproduces it as inline asm. Requirements (checked by `tools/lbpgate.py`): the header has `asm=vfpu`; every
`asm` template holds only VFPU instructions (`lv.q`, `sv.q`, `vadd.q`, `vdot.q`, `mtv`, `mfv`, `vsync`, ...); a comment
line in the source starts `Original inline VFPU asm:` and says what in the retail code shows it (for example a block of
VFPU instructions with the compiler's own register moves around it that no C construct produces). General-register
instructions inside an asm template remain forbidden. hst-decomp keeps its stricter rule.

## Source quality

The owner reviews every source at the end, so aim for the code the developers wrote.

- Among exact variants, keep the most natural one: real control flow (loops, early returns, `switch`), structs and
  member access instead of `*(int *)(p + 0x14)` when the layout is clear, `bool` and enums where obvious.
- Avoid matching hacks: duplicated conditions, dummy locals or parameters that only steer register allocation,
  `volatile`, self-assignments, gratuitous casts or `goto`. When one of them is the **only** exact form you found,
  keep it, but name it in the note line ("matching idiom: <what>"); `lbplint.py` counts those.
- Names: use a descriptive name only when the evidence supports it (strings, callers, documented research findings);
  otherwise keep the Ghidra address names. Never invent semantics.
- Be consistent: one declaration per symbol across the tree (`lbplint.py` reports symbols declared with different
  types in different sources).

## Near misses

If a function ends within about six differing words but not exact, save your best attempt to
`wip/<short_name>_<addr8>.cpp` (same header) with trailing `//` comments: what differs and what you ruled out. Files
in `wip/` are not built by `--all` and are not verified; they are leads for the next person.

## Compiler notes

Read [docs/TOOLCHAIN.md](docs/TOOLCHAIN.md) first: which compiler and flags built each part of LittleBigPlanet, with
the evidence. Where LBP shares a compiler with Hot Shots Tennis, hst-decomp's verified codegen facts apply unchanged:
[docs/reference/HST-MWCC-DIGEST.md](docs/reference/HST-MWCC-DIGEST.md) (by topic) and
[docs/reference/HST-MWCC-NOTES.md](docs/reference/HST-MWCC-NOTES.md) (the log, frozen copy). New LBP findings go to
`docs/TOOLCHAIN.md` (append one dated line under "Findings log", naming the function address).

## Checks before you finish

```
python tools/lbpmatch.py <every file you added or changed>     # EXACT n/n
python tools/lbplint.py                                         # no header findings
```

When a change adds files, `python tools/lbpreuse.py check` confirms that every tracked file is covered by the licence
map (`REUSE.toml`); new library sources need `python tools/lbpreuse.py newlib --write` first. `ORIGINS.json` is a
snapshot made by `python tools/lbporigin.py`; refresh it before a release (`lbppublish.py` classifies afresh).

For a change that touches many sources, `python tools/lbpmatch.py --all` is the full regression (it shares `build/`
with any concurrent run, so run one at a time).
